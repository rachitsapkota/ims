	<p><h4><u><i>What are some of the benefits of receiving my bill electronically?</i></u><br>
	It is convenient, saves time, reduces errors, allows you to receive bills anywhere at any time and helps the environment by saving trees. You can continue to receive a paper bill, but if you elect to go paperless, you can always print out a copy of the invoice if needed.<hr><hr>
	<u><i>What are the benefits of paying a bill online?</i></u><br>
	Paying online with a credit card or electronic check saves time, gives you the flexibility to pay how and when desired, and saves money (no more stamps, paper checks or envelopes), and Invoice Cloud will store your information for future use – but only if you choose to store it.;<hr><hr>
	<u><i>What is Invoice Cloud?</i></u><br>
	Invoice Cloud is a web-based, electronic invoice presentment and payment company that we have partnered with to provide faster, more convenient billing services to our customers. By automating billing and collections, customers can click and pay online while helping the environment and reducing clutter in their home or workspace<hr><hr>
	<u><i>How does the system work?</i></u><br>
	It is very simple. Here are the 3 steps taken by customers:<br>
	Customer receives email notification or accesses account via the Providence Water website by clicking on the “View Invoice or Pay Now” button.
	Customer locates and views invoice and either enters payment information for a “One Time Payment” or registers to schedule a payment.
	Customer receives an email confirmation with their payment amount and payment process date.<hr><hr>
	<u><i>Can I use an Apple /Mac to use the service?</i></u><br>
	Yes, many customers use Macs.<hr><hr>
	<u><i>What Browsers are supported?</i></u><br>
	The service supports all modern browsers.<hr><hr>
	<u><i>Do I need to register to pay a bill?</i></u><br>
	You may need to register to receive electronic bills by email, but registration is not required for One Time Payments. One Time Payments require that you enter your payment information each time you make a payment. By registering, you avoid that step and gain access to your payment history.<hr> <hr>
	<u><i>Why should I register to pay a bill?</i></u><br>
	By registering, you have access to all of your invoices regardless of type and all of the features of the payment portal. These features include the ability to view all current invoices, see previous invoices and payment dates, update your profile information, access the online customer service system, go paperless (if bill type allows), schedule  payments for a specific dates, and sign up for Auto-Pay. You also avoid having to enter your payment information each time you pay a bill. 
	<hr> <hr>
	<u><i>How Do I Register?</i></u><br>
	Registering is easy and can be done when you make a payment. There are two ways you can make a payment.
	When you receive an email notification that your bill is ready to paid, simply click on the “View Invoice or Pay Now” button. You will be directed to Providence Water’s “Pay and/or View Bills Online” site, powered by Invoice Cloud. Once there, you will be given the opportunity to register or make a One Time Payment. If you choose to register, you will be asked to provide a password and accept the terms and conditions to use the system. The payment information you enter in your profile will then be securely encrypted and saved for your next visit. <br>
	You can go directly to Providence Water’s website and click on the “Pay Online” button. You will then be directed to Providence Water’s “Pay and/or View Bills Online” site, powered by Invoice Cloud. Once there, you will need to locate your account and be given the opportunity to register or make a one time payment. If you choose to register, you will be asked to provide a password and accept the terms and conditions to use the system. The payment information you enter in your profile will then be securely encrypted and saved for your next visit.<hr><hr>
	<u><i>How do I find my account number to login?</i></u><br>
	Once you have registered, you will need only your email address and password to log in. To login the first time you use the system, you will need your account number or customer ID from your bill. The “locate your bill” screen gives instructions regarding the required information.<hr><hr>
